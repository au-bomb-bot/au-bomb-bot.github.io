# Progress This Week

This week, we successfully launched our project website, detailing our mission in the first post. We also completed the Capstone Design Project (CDP) and identified potential Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), with one expressing interest in joining our project.

# Project Risks and Obsticles

So far, we've encountered a few obstacles, primarily needing to clarify with our client whether they prefer an autonomous or manually controlled robot. This was a key point raised by our SME. As for risks, the main concern is the potential for electronics to spark within the explosive atmosphere chamber during testing, which means we'll need to be extremely careful if we integrate any electronic devices inside.

# Plans for Future

Our plans for the upcoming week include meeting with our Mechanical engineer to bring them up to speed, speaking with more potential SMEs for our project, and discussing the overarching tasks to create a Gantt chart.

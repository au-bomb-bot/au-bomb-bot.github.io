# Progress This Week

This week, the team made significant progress on the Explosive Atmosphere Chamber Robotic System. They successfully created rudimentary concept ideas for the robotic arm, laying the groundwork for future design. Additionally, they completed the introduction for their Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and strategically delegated responsibilities for research and design among team members. These accomplishments mark key steps forward in the project's development.

# Project Risks and Obsticles

This week, the team encountered difficulties focusing on the project and finding suitable meeting times due to midterms. Additionally, the lack of exact chamber dimensions has hindered the start of precise model work. A primary risk facing the project is the challenge of blending mechanical and electrical ideas and designs into a coherent product, especially as team members are working on separate sections.

# Plans for Future

This week, the team plans to further flesh out the concepts they have decided to pursue and begin work on CAD models. They also intend to meet with Dr. Roberts for their bi-weekly report.

# Team Meeting

On September 30 and October 3, 2025, the team focused on refining concept ideas and identifying solutions for the Explosive Atmosphere Robotic System. They agreed that a robotic arm with at least one joint is essential and explored commercial motor options, considering factors like cost, size, and placement inside or outside the chamber. The team discussed various switch actuation methods, including stylus-equipped claws and multipurpose attachments, and emphasized the need to accommodate different switch types and touchscreen interactions. Visibility within the chamber was also addressed, with ideas such as fiber optics and protective camera casings. Tool exchange mechanisms—manual, multipurpose, and automatic—were considered, along with mounting strategies and material choices to ensure safety in explosive environments. The team planned to research these concepts further and develop decision matrices to evaluate their feasibility.

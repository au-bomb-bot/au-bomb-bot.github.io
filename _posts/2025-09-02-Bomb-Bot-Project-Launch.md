# The Mission

Our primary goal is to design and build a robotic system capable of operating inside an explosive atmosphere chamber. This system needs to be able to manipulate a variety of controls, from simple toggle switches and rotary dials to modern touchscreens,all without causing damage or creating a spark. Safety and precision are paramount, as the chamber itself cannot be modified. On top of that, the entire system must be built to withstand the rigorous conditions defined by MIL-STD-810H testing.

# Cross-Disciplinary Challenge

This project is a fantastic opportunity for engineers from multiple disciplines to collaborate and innovate. It sits at the exciting intersection of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.

Bringing these fields together is what makes this project so compelling. We'll be blending hardware design with software intelligence to solve a real-world problem. Stay tuned for more updates as we get started!
